# Currency

This React component let you format any currency based on these criteria:

- Using props
- Using a Context Provider
- Guessing the default browser locale

Behind the curtain this component is using `Number` component with some default props.

## Props

`Currency` props are the same as `Number` props, but with the `currency` prop set by default, which is the one that enables the currency formatting.

Props are matching `Intl.NumberFormat` parameters (with some exception). So [if you need a detailed explanation for any prop please visit their documentation site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormat#Parameters).

## Usage

<Playground style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around" }}>
  <Currency>201300.9832</Currency>
  <Currency locale="de-DE" currency="EUR">
    201300.9832
  </Currency>
  <Currency as="span" maximumFractionDigits={3}>
    201300.9832
  </Currency>
</Playground>

The recommended way to use this component is within a React Context Provider to set a global config.
